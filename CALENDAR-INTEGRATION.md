# Calendar Integration Removal

## Overview
The Google Calendar integration has been removed from the application to simplify the permissions model and provide a more streamlined experience for users. The application now uses a standalone calendar component without requiring access to users' Google Calendar data.

## Changes Made
1. Removed Google Calendar API integration from the MiniCalendar component
2. Removed Google Calendar scopes from authentication
3. Simplified the calendar event display to use only application events
4. Removed Google Calendar-specific API routes

## Files Affected
- `/app/components/mini-calendar.tsx` - Simplified to use only local events
- `/lib/auth.ts` - Removed Google Calendar scopes from authentication
- `/types/next-auth.d.ts` - Removed Google Calendar token fields

## Files That Can Be Safely Removed
The following files are no longer needed and can be safely deleted:
- `/app/api/calendar/index.ts` - Google Calendar API client initialization
- `/app/api/calendar/events/route.ts` - Google Calendar events API endpoint

## Benefits
- Improved privacy for users
- Reduced permission requirements
- Simplified codebase
- Faster authentication process
- No dependency on third-party calendar services
